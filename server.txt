One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
 armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sec
tions. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with th
e size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a pro
per human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread 
out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated m
agazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur
 muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops 
of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this n
onsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state
 couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tri
ed it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a
 mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. "Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travellin
g day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's 
the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so 
that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!" He felt a slight itch up on his belly; push
ed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it
 was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his 
legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position.
 "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a li
fe of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are alwa
ys still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, m
aybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd h
ave gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off
 his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, espe
cially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money t
ogether to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll mak
e the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five." And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on 
the chest of drawers. "God in Heaven!" he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later t
han half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'cloc
k as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?
 True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at sev
en; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all f
eel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would
 have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago. The 
office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely 
strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the
 doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make
 any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's more, would he have been entirely wro
ng in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt muc
h hungrier than usual. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horribl
